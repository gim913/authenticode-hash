authenticode-hash
=================

Old code for calculating (and checking) Authenticode hash in D

If you'd like to compile this, you're gonna need *some* version of http://dsource.org/projects/tango
but I don't remember which one :P (I guess 0.99.8 or earlier)

compile is d breeze with `rebuild` from dsss http://www.dsource.org/projects/dsss/wiki/Rebuild
